# DrinkBot
## Description
Inspired by the Rich Gibson's HelloDrinkBot (https://github.com/RichGibson/hellodrinkbot), the DrinkBot uses a RPI 3 and an Adafruit Motor Hat (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348) to pump liquids from source to cup.  We added 4 buttons for different selections of drinks.

##Submodules
This project uses the Adafruit Motor Hat Library and the the Hellodrinkbot source code. If you need these libraries, run `git submodule update --init` after you clone to grab them.
